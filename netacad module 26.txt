Name two tools which can view pcaps in security onion;capme and wireshark.
Snort is a ...;Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).
Zeek is a ...;Policy based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).
Bro is now called...;Zeek.
OSSEC is...;A Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). Requires endpoints run an agent.
Wuzah is...;Another Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) which will replace OSSEC eventually, also requires endpoints run an agent.
Suricata is...;A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) which uses a signature based approach. It has better multithreading that Zeek and Snort.
To fetch Snort rule updates, use...;Pulled pork.
Squil is...;A high-level console for investigating alerts from a wide variety of sources.
A log analyser with user definable dashboards.;Kibana.
A full network packet capture and analyser;Wireshark.
What is in a Snort rule header?;The rule header contains the action, protocol, source and destination IP addresses and netmasks, and the source and destination port information.
What is in a Snort rule options section?;The rule options section contains alert messages and information on which parts of the packet should be inspected to determine if the rule action should be taken.
What are the GPL Snort rules?;GPLv2 licensed rules from before Cisco acquired Snort.
What are the ET Snort rules?;BSD licensed rules from Proofpoint.
What are the VRT Snort rules?;Cisco Talos rules. Released immediately to subscribers and 30 days later to registered users.
What are the three sources of rules for Snort?;GPL, ET, VRT.
How does Squil store IP Addresses?;IP Addresses are stored as uint32, so you need to use INET_ATON() to convert from dotted decimal.
What is the "ST" field in Squil?;Status of the alert, an indicator of priority.
What is the "CNT" field in Squil?;Count.
What are the fields in a Squil alert ID?;The first number is the alert ID, the second number is the event ID.
#
What is the correct alert outcome for a real event?;True positive.
What is the alert outcome for an alert which wasn't real?;False positive.
What are the possible alert outcomes?;True positive, false positive, true negative, false negative.
#
What is deterministic risk analysis?;Based on what is known about a vulnerability. Assumes all steps in the attack are successful, and therefore represents the worst case.
What is Probabilistic risk analysis?;Based on estimates of the probability that an event will occur.
