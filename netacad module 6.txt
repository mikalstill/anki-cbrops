# I have chosen to not include lots of detail on IPv4 headers here because its
# fiddly to know and I suspect might not be likely on the exam. I might be
# wrong there though...
#
What is a Hub?;Layer 1. A simple repeater. All received packets are flooded out all interfaces except the one the packet was received on. Traffic is half duplex as all interfaces on the hub form a single collision domain.
What is a Switch?;Layer 2. Maintains a MAC address table of addresses per port, and only floods traffic when it doesn't have a MAC address table entry for the recipient. If it does have one, only the recorded interface is used. Can be a full duplex device, as each interface is its own collision domain.
What is a Bridge?;Layer 2. Interconnect two layer 2 networks. The concept is largely obsolete now, but they perform buffering and speed translation between these networks. Bridging is not routing, the two joined networks effectively become one.
What is a Router?;Layer 3. Maintain a route table and move traffic between otherwise separate networks.
#
What are the layers in the OSI model?;Bottom to top: Please Do Not Teach Students Pointless Acronyms (PDNTSPA). Physical, Data link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
What are the layers of the TCP/IP model?;Application, Transport, Network, Data Link.
What OSI Layers map to the TCP/IP Application Layer?;Application, Presentation, Session (the top three).
What OSI Layers map to the TCP/IP Data Link Layer?;Data Link, Physical (the bottom two).
#
What IEEE specification covers the Data Link Layer in the OSI model for Ethernet?;802.2
What IEEE specification covers the Physical Layer in the OSI model for Ethernet?;802.3
#
How does Ethernet handle collisions?;Using Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). Devices check for a carrier before sending, if a collision is detected during sending devices wait a random amount of time before retrying.
#
What are three characteristics of IPv4?;It is connection-less, best effort, and media independent.
How bit are IPv4 addresses?;32 bits.
What protocol number is ICMP in IPv4?;1
What protocol number is TCP in IPv4?;6
What protocol number is UDP in IPv4?;17
What protocol number is OSPF in IPv4?;89
#
What is the netmask in a class A IPv4 netblock?;The first 8 bits of the address.
What is the netmask in a class B IPv4 netblock?;The first 16 bits of the address.
What is the netmask in a class C IPv4 netblock?;The first 24 bits of the address.
What is the first octet in a Class A IPv4 address?;0xxxxxxx (0-127) 0 and 127 networks are reserved.
What is the first octet in a Class B IPv4 address?;10xxxxxx (128-191).
What is the first octet in a Class C IPv4 address?;110xxxxx (192-223).
What is the first octet in a Class D IPv4 address?;1110xxxx (224-239).
What is the first octet in a Class E IPv4 address?;1111xxxx (240-255).
What are class D addresses used for in IPv4?;Multicast.
What are class E addresses used for in IPv4?;Reserved for future use.
What IP Addresses are reserved in a IPv4 netblock?;First address (all 0s) in a netblock is the network address, the last address (all 1s) in a netblock is the broadcast address.
What are the RFC1918 IPv4 netblocks?;Private non-routable addresses. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.
