#
Define Discretionary Access Control (DAC)   The least restrictive model, ACLs are used to grant users and groups access to data. Each resource has a clearly identified owner and that owner decides the access of others. For example a file on a unix filesystem.
Define Mandatory Access Control (MAC)   The strictest model generally used in military and mission critical applications. Access is granted based on a user's security clearance by the Operating System and owner has no control over who can access. Each resource is classified by sensitivity or security label. SELinux is an example of a real world system using MAC.
Define Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Users are one or more roles by the systems administrator, and these roles are used to grant access.
Define Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)    Attributes of the user, the requested resource, and environmental factors such as time of day are used to determine if access should be granted.
Define Time-based Access Control (TAC)  Access is granted based on time of day and the day.
