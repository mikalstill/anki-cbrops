This repository is a personal collection of Anki questions for the Cisco Cyberops CBROPS 200-201 certification. I'm happy to accept contributions and bug reports via github, please use github issues and pull requests for those.

Anki is an Open Source flash card application available at https://apps.ankiweb.net/ -- there are clients available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and smart phones. To use these flash cards, import them into an Anki deck using the "import file" button at the bottom of the main screen.
