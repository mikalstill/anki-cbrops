This repository came from https://github.com/mikalstill/anki-cbrops.

This is a personal collection of Anki questions for the Cisco Cyberops
CBROPS 200-201 certification. I'm happy to accept contributions and bug
reports via github, please use github issues and pull requests for
those.

Anki is an Open Source flash card application available at
https://apps.ankiweb.net/ -- there are clients available for Windows, MacOS,
Linux, and smart phones. To use these flash cards, import them into an Anki
deck using the "import file" button at the bottom of the main screen.

The majority of these questions were created by taking my notes from the
Cisco NetAcademy course for Cisco Cyberops Associate and turning them into
questions and answers. There is however some amount of difference between
the content of the official certification guide and the NetAcademy course.

Files name `netacad module XX.txt` are from the NetAcademy course. Files
named `extra XX.txt` are things covered by the certification guide but not
present in the NetAcademy course. I don't know if that means they're less
likely to appear on the exam or whatever, I'd rather include them here
just in case.
