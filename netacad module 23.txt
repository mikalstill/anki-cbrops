Who manages the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)?;The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) has been designated as the custodian of the CVSS to promote its adoption globally.
What is in the CVSS base metric group?;Exploitability (attack vector, complexity, privileges required, user interaction required), and impact (based around the CIA triad).
What is in the CVSS temporal metric group?;Exploit maturity, remediation level, and report confidence.
What is in the CVSS environmental metric group?;Modified base metrics based on the particular software.
What does a CVSS score below 4 mean?;The important of the vulnerability is low.
What does a CVSS score between 4 and 7 mean?;The importance of the vulnerability is medium.
What does a CVSS score between 7 than 9 mean?;The importance of the vulnerability is high.
What does a CVSS score greater than 9 mean?;The vulnerability is critical.
#
What is a CVE?;Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE), a unique vulnerability identifier managed by MITRE. CVEs are issued by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). Aggregated at cve.mitre.org, and nvd.nist.org. Used as a reference to a specific vulnerability to aid in searching.
What is the NVD?;National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a database of CVEs and their associated CVSS maintained by the US Federal Government.
Where can you find a list of CVEs?;In the National Vulnerability Database -- http://nvd.nist.gov
#
What is the vulnerability management lifecycle?;Discover (inventory all assets across the network), prioritize assets (categorize assets into groups or business units, and assign a business value to asset groups), assess 9determine a baseline risk profile), report (measure the level of business risk, document a security plan, monitor suspicious activity, and describe known vulnerabilities), remediate (prioritize according to business risk and address vulnerabilities in order of risk), and verify: (through follow-up audits).
