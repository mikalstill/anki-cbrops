What are the steps in a HTTPS handshake?    The client sends a request to the server for a secure session. The server responds by sending its X.509 digital certificate to the client.

The client and server now both know the symmetric key and can use the SSL encryption process to encrypt and decrypt the information contained in the client request and the server response.
